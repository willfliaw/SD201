# Data Mining (SD201) - 2023/2024

## Course Overview

This repository contains materials and resources for the course **SD201: Data Exploration**, part of the **Data & Artificial Intelligence** curriculum. The course focuses on algorithms for data analysis and exploration, including both theoretical and practical aspects. Students will work with top-performing algorithms for clustering, ranking, decision trees, and recommendation systems, and will implement these algorithms in real-world data analysis projects.

### Key Topics:

- Clustering: Algorithms for grouping data based on similarity.
- Ranking: Techniques for ordering data based on relevance or other criteria.
- Recommendation Systems: Methods for suggesting items based on user behavior and preferences.
- Decision Trees: Supervised learning algorithms for classification and regression tasks.

## Prerequisites

Students are expected to have basic knowledge of:
- Data structures and algorithms
- Programming: Python programming will be used in practical sessions.

## Course Structure

- Total Hours: 24 hours of in-person sessions (16 sessions), including:
  - 12 hours of practical work
  - 12 hours of lectures
- Estimated Self-Study: 38.5 hours
- Credits: 2.5 ECTS
- Evaluation: The course is assessed through practical projects, written exams, and continuous evaluation.

## Instructor

- Professor Mauro Sozio

## Installation and Setup

For practical exercises, you will need Python and relevant libraries for data analysis. Follow the instructions below to set up your environment using `conda`:

1. Anaconda/Miniconda: Download and install Python with Anaconda or Miniconda from [Conda Official Site](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/).
2. Necessary Libraries: Create a new conda environment with the required packages:
   ```bash
   conda create -n sd201 python numpy pandas matplotlib scipy scikit-learn jupyter ipykernel
   ```
3. Activate the environment:
   ```bash
   conda activate sd201
   ```

4. Launch Jupyter Notebook (if required for exercises):
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

This setup will allow you to complete the data exploration tasks and implement the algorithms covered in the course.
